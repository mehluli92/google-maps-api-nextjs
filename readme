#This is a google maps integration using Next js.
#The instructions to run the application are as follows:
- Ensure that you have Node js running in your environment
- Download the app from this repository.
- Add a google maps api key in the .env.local. Please note that I did not have access to a free API key so i borrowed a live one for use during development but had to remove it whilst posting on giithud.
- Run npm install to install dependencies on the app
- Run npm run dev on the terminal and access the application.
